# Big Video Tools & Features
This repository is a collection point for ideas, wishes and suggestions for tools and features to enhance the Big Video workflow for qualitative video analysis.
We use our BigSoftVideo space in GitHub to develop software tools to support Big Video. Most of the coding we do is private until a robust beta is released publicly.
The software development team at present includes Paul McIlvenny, Jacob Davidsen, Nicklas Haagh Christensen and Andreas Hejndorf.
We are working on three software projects at the moment:
1. *CAVA360VR* (Collaborate, Annotate, Visualise, Analyse 360 video in VR) - Stage 3 beta
2. *SQUIVE* (Staging QUalitative Immersive Virtualisation Engine) - Stage 2 beta
3. *DOTE* (Distributed Open Transcription Environment) - Stage 1 alpha

We are always interested in ideas and suggestions for tools and features that will support the Big Video workflow of qualitative video analysis. You may have seen a demo of one of our tools in beta, read one of our papers, or you may have strong feelings about the software currently available (eg. TRANSANA, ELAN, CLAN, ANVIL, etc). If you would like to share with us, then add them as an issue here in this repository (click in the menu above). You will have to create an account with GitHub to do so. Describe your suggestion or request in as much detail as you wish. Include sketches or images if you wish. You can respond to other issues and add emojis to indicate your assessment and/or support.
